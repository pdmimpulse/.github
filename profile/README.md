# We are pdm! And we are hiring :) 👋

## Who are we? 
We are the in-house innovation team of [pdm solutions GmbH](https://pdm-solutions.com/en/), a berlin-based software studio that manages the digital presence of well-known German SME directories including [Gelbe Seiten](https://www.gelbeseiten.de/) (Yellow Pages), [Das Telefonbuch](https://www.dastelefonbuch.de/), and [Das Örtliche](https://www.dasoertliche.de/) (The Local). 

Our innovation team comprises of two major branches: AI and Platform. 
  - The AI Team explores application-layer use case of AI both in internal process optimization and new product prototyping. The team develops multiple projects of different sizes at the same time and are more tech-heavy
  - The Platform Team examines new platform business ideas and build prototypes one project at a time and is more business-heavy

The AI Team looks to hire both full-stack and specialist engineers.
